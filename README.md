### Building on Windows

* Please note that if you are the average user **YOU DO NOT NEED TO BUILD TO PLAY REBUILT**. This is for developers or for those with different preferences.

* Make sure you have [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net48) installed and have a functioning IDE for C#

Recommended IDE: [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022)

* Clone The Repository
```
git clone https://www.github.com/nikled/duckgames
```

* Find the repo folder and launch the .sln file

* In `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Duck Game`: Do `ctrl+A` to select all files, then deselect `DuckGame.exe` by holding `ctrl` and left clicking the file, then copy the files with ctrl+C. Then, in `DuckGames\bin` paste the files with `ctrl+V`

  cp System.Memory.dll bin/
  cp System.Buffers.dll bin/
  cp System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll bin/

  cp PresentationFramework.dll bin/
  ```

* Go to your own DG steam somewhere like `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Duck Game/` and copy the Content folder to the `bin/` directory.
