Is that a PS4 Controller?

It seems you may have a |DGBLUE|PS4 Controller
plugged in! If so, and if you are running
|DGBLUE|DS4Windows|PREV| or a |DGBLUE|3rd party PS4 Controller Driver|PREV|,
you may need to |DGRED|disable|PREV| it.
If everything works okay, you can ignore
this message. If you're controlling 2 ducks
at once, then this message is for you!

Steam Not Connected!
It seems that either you're not logged in
to Steam, or Steam failed to authenticate.
You can still play- but realtime
features like Online Play and the Workshop
will be |DGRED|unavailable|PREV|.
MODS CHANGED!
@SELECT@I see...
To ensure a smooth update, all enabled
mods have been temporarily set to |DGRED|disabled|PREV|.
Mod compatibility has been a high priority, and
most mods should work no problem with the new version.
They can be re-enabled through the |DGORANGE|MANAGE MODS|PREV| menu
accessible via the top left options console.
Some older mods may |DGRED|not|PREV| work...
Please be mindful of any crashes caused by
re-enabling specific mods, and use the '|DGBLUE|-nomods|PREV|'
launch option if you run into trouble!

PLAYING ONLINE
There are many tools of expression
in Duck Game. Please use them for
|PINK|love|WHITE| and not for |DGRED|hate...|WHITE|
Things every Duck aught to remember:
-Trolling and hate appear exactly the same online.
-Please! be kind to one another.                  
-Please! don't use hate speech or strong words.   
-Please! don't use hacks in public lobbies.       
-Please! keep custom content tasteful.            
-Angle shots are neat (and are not hacks).        
If anyone is hacking or being unkind, please
hover their name in the pause menu
and go 'Mute -> Block'.
